# Personalized-Restaurant-Recommender-System
A restaurant recommender system is a software system that provides personalized restaurant recommendations to users based on their preferences. These systems can be used to help users discover new restaurants, find restaurants that are a good match for their dietary restrictions, or simply find a restaurant that is nearby and has good reviews.

### Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop a restaurant recommender system that could provide accurate and personalized recommendations to users. The system was developed using a machine learning algorithm called collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering algorithms work by analyzing the ratings that users have given to items in the past to learn about their preferences. The system then uses this information to recommend new items to users that they are likely to enjoy.

### Project Implementation

The following steps were taken to implement the restaurant recommender system:

Data collection: A dataset of restaurant ratings was collected from a variety of online sources. The dataset included the following information:
Cuisines
Restaurant ID
Rating (1-5 stars)
Data preparation: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for use in the machine learning algorithm. This included removing incomplete or invalid data, and converting the ratings to a numerical format.
Model training: The collaborative filtering algorithm was trained on the preprocessed dataset. This involved training the algorithm to learn the relationships between users and restaurants.
Model evaluation: The trained model was evaluated to assess its performance on a held-out test set. This helped to ensure that the model was able to generalize to new data.
System deployment: The trained model was deployed to a web server so that users could access it and receive restaurant recommendations.

### Project Contributions

The following contributions were made to the development of the restaurant recommender system:

A collaborative filtering algorithm was implemented to provide accurate and personalized restaurant recommendations to users.
A web application was developed to allow users to interact with the system and receive restaurant recommendations.
A dataset of restaurant ratings was collected and preprocessed for use in the machine learning algorithm.
The trained model was evaluated to assess its performance on a held-out test set.

The restaurant recommender system is a valuable tool that can help users discover new restaurants and find restaurants that are a good match for their preferences. The system is easy to use and provides personalized recommendations to users based on their ratings and the ratings of other users.
